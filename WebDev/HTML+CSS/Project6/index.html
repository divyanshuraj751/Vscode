    <h1>CuttleFish</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>
        Cuttlefish, or cuttles, are marine <a href="#nowhere">molluscs</a> of the order Sepiida. They belong to the class Cephalopoda which
        also includes squid, octopuses, and nautiluses. Cuttlefish have a unique internal shell, the cuttlebone, which
        is used for control of buoyancy.
    </p>
    <p>
        Cuttlefish have large, W-shaped pupils, eight arms, and two tentacles furnished with denticulated suckers, with
        which they secure their prey. They generally range in size from 15 to 25 cm (6 to 10 in), with the largest
        species, the giant cuttlefish (Sepia apama), reaching 50 cm (20 in) in mantle length and over 10.5 kg (23 lb) in
        mass.

    <h2>Taxonomy and etymology</h2>
    <p>
        "Cuttle" in "cuttlefish", sometimes called "cuttles",[4] is derived from the Old English name for the species,
        cudele. The word may be cognate with the Old Norse koddi (cushion) and the Middle Low German Kudel (rag).[5]
        Over 120 species of cuttlefish are currently recognised, grouped into six families divided between two
        suborders. One suborder and three families are extinct
